I have been assigned a project during my internship period in SAM Engineering & Equipment (M) Berhad in which I am required to write a PowerShell script that could automate the software installation process on a laptop/desktop/workstation. The script enable software to be installed with little to no human interaction and silently which means there is no pop-ups during the installation process. I have prepared a technical report in which it properly details on how to use the script and how to troubleshoot if problems occurred.
